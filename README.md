# Snake Game
Classic 2D snake game developed with Swing GUI and AWT.

## How to Play
To play, use the arrow keys to move the snake (the green square(s)) in the desired direction. When the snake eats apples (red squares), it gets longer. The goal is to make the snake as large as possible. However, the game is over if the snake collides with itself or the blue border.
